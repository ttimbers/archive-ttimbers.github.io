On Feb 1-3 the Library's Research Commons at Simon Fraser University (SFU) hosted 
Vancouver's first Research Bazaar ([#ResBaz](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23resbaz) on twitter). What is a [Research Bazaar](https://feb2016.resbaz.com/) you 
might ask? It is a festival of sorts whose theme is digital literacy emerging at the 
center of modern research. Research Bazaar originated in Melbourne Austrailia in 2015, and
spread across the globe to 10 sites this year. 

[SFU's Research Bazaar](http://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/rc/networking/research-bazaar) kicked off with a day of short, hands-on workshops covering a 
wide-range of topics including, finding and managing data, qualitative data analysis 
software (QDAS), LaTeX, ArcGIS, text scraping and parsing web content, and social media
for research and researchers. I attended the LaTeX session taught by SFU Ph.D. student, 
[Ross Churchley](http://rosschurchley.com/). Ross did an excellent job introducing the key points of LaTeX to a group
of > 20 people in under 2 hours. The workshop was so practical, that I, someone who has 
never used LaTeX previously, have already started to write my next manuscript using this
tool. 

In the afternoon session, I attended back to back sessions on Building an Online Academic 
Presence (by SFU Library's Rebecca Dowson) and Social Media for Research and Researchers
(by UBC's [Amy Lee](https://twitter.com/minisciencegirl?lang=en)). Both sessions were well worth attending and I came up with a largeish
(but I think doable) to do list to increase my online profile and reputation (see below). 

We wrapped up Day 1 over a Hacky Hour at Club Ilia on SFU's campus. Hacky Hours are 
informal meetups where members of the research community can get together and talk 
everything from data, coding, technology to open research. We've had several of these in 
Vancouver recently, and they are full of great discussions as well as a great way to meet
other researchers to network, connect and collaborate with.

The last two days of SFU's Research Bazaar included three parallel 2 day workshops and 
included a visual analytics workshop centred around Tableau and Gephi, a R workshop run
by [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/), and a Python workshop also run by Software Carpentry. I taught part
of the Python workshop, my third time teaching this topic, and had a lot of fun. 

Overall, I think Vancouver's first Research Bazaar at SFU was a big hit and I'd really 
like to the Library's Research Commons, the [Scientific Programming Study Group at SFU](http://sciprog.ca/),
and the Vancouver Software Carpentry Community for making this happen. Looking forward
to hopefully having an even bigger and better event in 2017!

### My Online Presence/Social Media To Do List
*From Rebecca's talk*
</br> 1. one online landing page to summarize my work (this will be [my blog](http://tiffanytimbers.com/))
</br> 2. make a better description of my blog, currently it says, "A minimal Jekyll theme for your blog by designer Michael Rose", which is not very helpful for me...
</br> 3. get an [orchidID](http://orcid.org/) 
</br> 4. try the [30 day Impact Challenge](http://blog.impactstory.org/research-impact-challenge-ebook/)
</br> 5. sign-up for Google Scholar alerts
</br> 6. check-out my Altmetric engagement via [Impact Story](https://impactstory.org/)

*Amy's talk*
</br> 1. start using lists on twitter
</br> 2. use analytics to assess whether your social media efforts are effective
</br> 3. use [Hootesuite](https://hootsuite.com/) to schedule tweets
</br> 4. use a better twitter client to follow hashtags (*e.g.,* [Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/))
</br> 5. engage with more people on twitter (be consistent on topics, have converstations)
