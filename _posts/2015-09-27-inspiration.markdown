<p>I have been thinking about starting a career-oriented blog for a while now, and it was
being asked to give a short talk at Simon Fraser University's (SFU) 1st Annual 
Postdoctoral Research Day about what it is like being a postdoc there (see my slide deck 
for that talk on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ttimbers/timbers-postdoc-researchday
2015">Slideshare</a>) that was the last push I needed to actually get started 
on this. 
<br />

<p> Why do I want to write a blog about my thoughts and ramblings about research, data, 
coding, teaching and all things related to science? First, I do this anyways via 
<a href="mailto:tiffany.timbers@gmail.com">emails</a> (to the lucky few I bother
a lot), <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/pub/tiffany-timbers/31/456/27a">LinkedIn</a>, 
<a href="https://twitter.com/tiffanytimbers">Twitter</a> and 
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ttimbers">Slideshare</a>, and so I wanted a place where
I could collate, assemble and/or randomly collect all of this information in the hopes 
that at having a landing space will be useful (at least for me). Second, I am 
inspired/impressed with how two scientists whom I have significant respect for, 
<a href="http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/">Ethan White</a> and 
<a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/">Titus Brown</a>, have created interesting and useful 
blogs, and I want to try to do what they do. <br />

<p> So here I go...
