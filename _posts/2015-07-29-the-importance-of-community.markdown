I just recently returned home from the 20th International *C. elegans* Meeting at
UCLA. I have to say that I absolutely love attending this meeting, not only for the 
amazing science that I see there at every meeting (highlights this year include new 
Crispr/Cas9 genome editing strategies and automated microinjections) but also because of 
the community. The worm community is unlike any other research community I have yet to 
encounter. 


Often times when I come home from a conference I am motivated because I see so 
much amazing science and I see many new ideas of how I can drive my research forward. At 
the same time though, I am often stressed out when I come home from a conference because
of the immensely competitive atmosphere in science these days (or perhaps it has always 
been this way). People holding back details of their techniques they are developing, or
not sharing gene or protein names so that they do not get scooped, as well as some 
indescribable competitive undercurrent that you can just "feel" in the air.


The worm meeting feels nothing like this. Yes, you might get some holding back of 
information, but I think what generates the different feel is the other stuff that happens
at the worm meeting. In our community, when two groups realize they are working on an 
extremely similar project, the first reaction is to propose a collaboration. I directly 
observed this several years ago between my Ph.D. supervisor, Catharine Rankin, and 
another worm researcher, Bill Schafer. If that is not a feasible option, then often the 
two research groups agree to co-submit, or at the very minimum keep each other well 
informed of where they are at on the projects. 


In addition to collaboration, in the worm community there is a standing rule that 
whenever you create a new reagent (strain or plasmid for example) you share it with anyone
who wants it, often by depositing it in a repository. Software resources, such as the many
worm tracking systems that have been developed relatively recently, are always open 
source. There is also a large push for everyone to share their data with the community on 
[Wormbase](http://www.wormbase.org). And as budgets grow tighter, this year
the community has been asked to play a larger role in curating and adding data to Wormbase
as we may not have the funds to hire more people to help deal with the data backlog (one
of the goals of wormbase is to integrate data from all *C. elegans* paper into the 
database).


Humor and creativity also play a significant role in shaping the worm community. This 
year we celebrated the 10 year anniversary of the worm art show, initiated and still run 
by the hilarious Ahna Skop. Top highlights for me were the human sized worm costume (which 
had a vulva so you could expel egg-shaped cushions) and the Wrecking Ball parody titled
[Weird Alegans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yYahjxTuqU&feature=youtu.be).
We also have a [worm comedy show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpVI4FZzU6M), 
and a dance (with a DJ and lasers and fog!). All of these events are not only tremendously
fun, but really help to build and keep the community together.


<p>There is a significant effect of attending a worm meeting. On the new graduate student,
there's a realization that there's another level as to how fun science can be, and that 
there are people who are really, truly interested in what they are doing. For the 
returning grad student, post-doc or PI, there's a sense of coming home and reconnecting 
with amazing people you do not get to see often enough. And in these tight times of 
science budgets, these meetings let you really see the amazing research that stems from 
all of us working together using *C. elegans<* as a model and convinces you to stick 
with this elegant little worm.  


Can't wait to see everyone again at the next International worm meeting!
