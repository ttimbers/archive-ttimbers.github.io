I am a Neurogenomicist who is trying to unravel how we see, smell and taste the world around us. To accomplish this I use advanced statistical genetic methods to reveal associations between the genome and the behavioral phenome of a model organism, the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*.
The goal is to reveal new genes important for sensing and responding to the environment. When I uncover new sensory genes, I then investigate their biological function in *C. elegans* and collaborate with human geneticists to assess their potential role in human sensory disorders.
Currently, I am a Postdoc at Simon Fraser University working with [Dr. Michel Leroux](http://www.sfu.ca/~leroux/).



This collaborative research works best in an open science framework and I strive to ensure all data and source code from my research is freely available to everyone. In addition to open access research, I participate in open science education and training as a [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) Instructor and Contributor.
