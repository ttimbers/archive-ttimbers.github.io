### Teaching: 
I work as a Teaching Fellow for the UBC Statistics Department where my primary role is to teach, develop curriculum and coordinate for the new Professional [Master of Data Science program](http://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/). In this program we teach cutting-edge tools and techniques that are used by data scientists out in the wild. 

### Research:
I am a Neurogenomicist who is trying to unravel how we see, smell and taste the world around us. To accomplish this I use statistical genetic methods to reveal associations between the genome and the behavioral phenome of a model organism, *C. elegans*. The goal is to reveal new genes important for sensing and responding to the environment. When we uncover new sensory genes we then investigate their biological function in *C. elegans* and collaborate with human geneticists to assess their potential role in human sensory disorders. 

This collaborative research works best in an open science framework and I strive to ensure all data and source code from my research is freely available to everyone. In addition to open access research, I participate in open science education and training as a Software Carpentry (http://software-carpentry.org/) Instructor, Contributor and Mentor.

My up-to-date *curriculum vitae* can be found [here](Timbers_CV.md).
