I am passionate about teaching science! Having profited from close interactions with faculty as an undergraduate at Carleton University, my goal is to teach and develop curriculum to enhance the training of future life scientists and medical professionals.
I have a large body of teaching experience spanning from working as a Teaching Assistant in Biology and Psychology at Carleton University and the University of British Columbia (UBC), working at UBC as an Instructor teaching a 3rd year Animal Behaviour course, mentoring/ supervising > 14 undergraduate students in the lab, teaching scientific programming workshops with Software Carpentry
and instructing a 3rd year [Computation in the Physical Sciences](http://phy3009.github.io/PHY3009-2015/) course at Quest University.

My teaching philosophy can be accessed [here](Timbers_teaching_philosophy.pdf).
